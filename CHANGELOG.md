## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Resume** — a state file recorded for a different target, or `--skip` / `--seek` /
  `--sector-size` values that conflict with the resumed state, are now refused with a clear
  message instead of silently reusing the old region map (previously a state file from another
  target could produce an all-zero target reported as "Done")
- **Resume** — the region map is reconciled with the current copy domain: resuming with a larger
  `--length` (or a grown source) now copies the new tail instead of reporting early completion,
  and a smaller `--length` no longer copies past the limit

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Initial release: `exhume <SOURCE> [TARGET] [STATE]` copies a block device or
  file to a target block-wise, defaulting the target to `grave.img` and the
  state file to `<TARGET>.state`
- **State file** — a human-readable TOML file recording the full run
  configuration (`[params]`), progress totals (`[progress]`), and a region map
  (`[[regions]]` with `untried` / `done` / `bad` status). Written atomically and
  checkpointed periodically and on `Ctrl-C`
- **Resume** — re-running the same command continues an interrupted copy, reading
  only still-untried regions; recorded parameters are reused unless overridden on
  the command line
- **Read-error tolerance** — read errors are recorded as `bad` regions and skipped
  instead of aborting the copy. A failed transfer block is re-read sector by
  sector so only the unreadable part is lost, not the whole block: capped at one
  page on a buffered source (read-ahead is switched off on the first error), and
  down to a single sector with `--direct`
- **`--skip-unchanged`** — reads each target block and writes only the ones that
  differ from the source, for refreshing an existing image/clone with minimal
  writes; the summary and state file report bytes written separately from bytes
  scanned (`progress.bytes_written`)
- **`--skip-zeros`** — leaves all-zero source blocks unwritten to keep the target
  sparse (like `dd conv=sparse`), without reading the target. A regular-file
  target is extended to the full size at the end so skipped trailing zeros still
  produce a correctly sized, sparse image. Warns when used on an occupied target,
  where pre-existing data would survive. Combinable with `--skip-unchanged`
- **`--retry`** — re-reads regions previously recorded as `bad` and recovers
  what is now readable, flipping them to `done`, at sector granularity. One pass
  per run; not sticky (each retry is opt-in, to avoid hammering failing media on
  every resume)
- **`--direct`** — reads the source with `O_DIRECT`, bypassing the page cache so
  a re-read (e.g. under `--retry`) actually reaches the medium instead of being
  served stale from cache. Reads only; Linux only; opt-in, for failing media
- **Overwrite safety** — writing to an existing block device or non-empty file
  requires `--force`; an existing matching state file enables resume instead
- **Auto-named state files are cleaned up** — when no `STATE` argument is given,
  the derived `<TARGET>.state` is removed after a copy that finishes with no
  errors, so a clean run leaves nothing behind (including on block-device
  targets). An explicitly named state file, or one left by an interrupted or
  error-hitting run, is kept for resume/inspection
- **Sector-aware copy** — the logical sector size is auto-detected from block
  devices (`BLKSSZGET`, falling back to 512 bytes) and used as the alignment and
  recovery granularity; healthy reads use a larger `--transfer-size` (default
  `1M`) aligned down to it. `--sector-size` overrides the detection. `--skip` and
  `--seek` must be whole sectors and are rejected up front otherwise, with the
  nearest aligned values suggested
- Size arguments (`--sector-size`, `--transfer-size`, `--length`, `--skip`,
  `--seek`) accept human-readable suffixes (`64K`, `1M`, `1.5G`, `4KiB`, `1MB`)
- Progress bar with throughput and ETA (suppressible with `--quiet`)
- **`--json`** — prints the final run summary as a single JSON object on stdout
  (status, paths, and byte/bad-region totals) for scripting; the progress bar
  still draws to stderr
